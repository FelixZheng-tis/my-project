  <h1>
    Finding The Problem
  </h1>

  <p>
    Learning coding and robotics is great, and getting high grade are pretty good to, but what some people
    forget is that the most important goal in learning all of this, is to actually solve problem and mak
    lives easier. This is one of the core princples that started this project. 
  </p>

  <p>The truth is
    I thought of this project while having luch on a saturday, at that point, the project proposal was already overdue
    and I still have not pined down what I want to so, initially, I thought that I would go learn hacking, but 
    to be honest with myself, deep down I felt no reason to go and learn that stuff. So as I was eating, I 
    suddenly thought of the possiblity of using this project to solve a real problem! Now that might seem
    very obvious, but let me tell you, it is easy for students to get caught up in grades, and forget the
    real point of learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyways, eventually I realized a problem that would be perfect for this project. Now, as you know, 
    I am in the robotics class, and one enormous annoyance and frustration for me when considering the
    awesome resources that is the innovation lab, is the fact that literally everything seems to go missing 
    every second. Basically, you can never find what you need, and you always lose what you were working 
    on. Its ridiculous! and what ends up happening is that you spend pretty much a third of your time 
    ,instead of innovating, find stuff. And about every 15 minutes, something you had, is now missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now not only is this completely inefficient, it is just infurriating as well. So the motivation to 
    solve this problem was definately there. And so now it was just time to come up with a solution...
